436,667490,Colonialism and Independence,"MODULE DESCRIPTION    The module aims to enhance your knowledge and understanding of post-colonial literatures in relation to the cultural, political and intellectual contexts from which they emerge. It will concentrate on texts concerned with African, Caribbean and Indian geographical regions showing linkages between their colonial experiences. You will read three sets of texts: first, narratives of colonial writers on the colonial encounter in Africa, India and the Caribbean; second, responses by natives of these communities to European representations of the encounter and its effects on people and the lands; third, contemporary texts on post independence. Theories to be considered will include Eurocentric theories of representation and others that take these theories as a point of  departure for rethinking European representation of the native. Various concepts including the colonial encounter, creolisation, contact zone, hybridity and hybridisation will be discussed, informed by the work of contemporary postcolonial theorists such as Edward Said, Homi Bhaba, and Ngugi wa Thiongo.    LEARNING OUTCOMES    On successful completion of this module you should be able to:  1. Recognise and critically reflect on the problematics of the colonial encounter.  2. Evaluate the significance of theories of representation in reading postcolonial texts.  3. Critically evaluate and engage with post-colonial texts demonstrating an ability to undertake sustained inter-disciplinary analysis."

451,667478,Modernism,"MODULE DESCRIPTION    This module aims to familiarise you with the cultural and intellectual movement of `Modernism¿. Roughly covering the period from the late nineteenth century to the Second World War, Modernism was a decisive change in approaches to literature: modernist writers such as Virginia Woolf, James Joyce or D.H. Lawrence moved away from the realist mode of the Victorians and started experimenting, both with form and content of their writing. In the course of this module, you will learn about the main theories behind literary Modernism ¿ we will also be looking at the parallel developments in the arts and in architecture ¿ and will study some examples of first- and second-generation modernist  writers.    LEARNING OUTCOMES    On successful completion of this module you will be able to  1. Demonstrate understanding of the two main trends of modernist writing (Modernism of Style / Modernism of Content).  2. Assess the use of recurrent themes in the examples of modernist writing  encountered on the module.  3. Situate the texts in their intellectual context and within an acknowledged theoretical framework."

484,667500,Literary Journalism,"MODULE DESCRIPTION    In this module we will briefly explore the historical development of literary journalism from the Eighteenth Century to the Twentieth Century and then spend time analysing and evaluating contemporary practice in the genre. Literary Journalism is sometimes defined narrowly to mean `writing about books¿, but in this module we will take it in its wider sense of `serious and creative non-fiction written to a high standard¿ (though the reflection on  larger issues may be prompted by the experience of literature or art). In its simultaneous commitment to reflection, to standards of good writing, and to public engagement, literary journalism seems to oppose itself to both ephemeral journalism (daily reporting, blogging) and purely academic criticism of literature and culture. We will ask, therefore, what is meant in this context by `serious¿ and `good¿ writing and how effective literary journalism is  produced. We will ask, too, to what extent literary journalists define themselves by either prescribing or describing standards of value in society and culture.    LEARNING OUTCOMES    On successful completion of this module you should be able to:  1. Analyse and evaluate the elements of effective prose in the context of a  comparative analysis of two or three extracts of literary journalism.  2. Demonstrate an understanding of the broad generic and formal features of  contemporary literary journalism and of the specific requirements of a particular  journal.  3. Critically assess public debate about a contemporary topic/issue"

487,667634,Politics of Policy Making,"Although students of politics and those hoping to work in the public sector need to pay attention to the `agenda setting¿ activities of parties and pressure groups in fact the way in which citizens interact with Government through the making and implementing of public policies is also profoundly political.    Public policies have far reaching consequences for citizens ranging from the restriction of liberty to the provision of free school meals. Without 'policy', governments could hardly act. Ministers cannot directly arrest criminals, provide health care to patients or teach this module. Rather Governments must act through such means as making or amending legislation, the allocation of public expenditure, executive action and manipulating the 'machinery of government' in various ways which are in themselves very political processes.    Common perceptions of contemporary public policy are that a widening range of actors and agencies are involved, but that government works harder to implement policy 'on the ground'. Increasingly Governments are seeking not only to respond to political demands but to shape agendas and encourage behaviour change from citizens.    The main aim of the course is to provide conceptual and empirical insights into the creation and implementation of public policy in the UK. The concepts considered include both the traditional post-war literature on policy making and implementation, and more recent concepts of 'governance'. Contemporary case studies will be used drawing on the fields of criminal justice, health and social care and other topical policy cases."

492,667617,Special Author: Wittgenstein,"The course examines some of the major themes from Wittgenstein¿s Tractatus Logico- Philosophicus (1921) and Philosophical Investigations (1953). Topics covered include:    ¿ On the Tractatus: facts and things; the picture theory of meaning; the nature of logic and necessity; the distinction between saying and showing.  ¿ On Philosophical Investigations: the relation between the Investigations and the Tractatus; the Augustinian picture of language and ostensive definition; meaning and use; following a rule; the private language argument, and the nature of mind and mental states."
493,667614,Philosophy of Language,"The philosophy of language treats the central philosophical issue of how language enables us to think and talk about things in the world. Issues addressed in this course include: Are names mere labels of the things they name? How should indirect speech be philosophically understood? Is there a distinction between the content of a sentence and the kind of speech acts in which the sentence figures? How should definite descriptions (terms such as `the G¿) be understood? What makes the noises and marks made by a speaker meaningful? Is there a distinction between what a sentence means and what is stated by someone who asserts it? Is truth a substantial property of our thoughts or just a linguistic device of some sort?    This course will engage with all these questions and examine carefully many of the central texts of philosophers who raise these questions, including Frege, Russell, Grice, and Quine. The course develops issues addressed in the second year module 20th Century Analytic Philosophy and complements both of the modules Philosophy of Mind and Metaphysics."

499,667604,Ethics,"This course will focus on four questions of ethics: (i) which sorts of things are of ethical value and disvalue? (people? their actions? their intentions? their characters? the situations that they get themselves into?), (ii) what does their possessing this value demand of us? (e.g. that we bring about the greatest happiness of the greatest number? that we treat others as ends, not means? that we do unto others as we would have them do unto us?), (iii) how do these demands motivate our actions (e.g. by arousing our passions, or our reason?), and (iv) why does it matter to us that these demands are met (i.e. why do we care about the demands that are made by morality)?"

505,667618,Philosophy of Psychology,"This course will be concerned with the problems of conscious experience, theories of perception, the modularity of mind, simulation theory, and the individuation of the senses. Philosophy of psychology draws on a range of empirical results in psychology, and this course will introduce students to scientific evidence that has a bearing on these philosophical issues."
506,667622,Philosophy of Mathematics,"This course will introduce students to the lively contemporary debate over the metaphysics of mathematics. Are there such things as numbers (or other mathematical objects)? If so, what they are like, and how do we manage to acquire knowledge of them? If these objects do not exist, then what is it that we know when we know that 2+2=4?    Discussion of technicalities will be kept to a minimum, and no special expertise in mathematics will be assumed. The arguments discussed raise important questions about the relation of philosophy to mathematics, science, and ordinary talk and belief; the course will place particular stress on these issues."
507,667630,Chinese Politics Today,"The course will provide a thematic survey of the important debates in Chinese politics. We will examine the workings of the Central Government, the Chinese Communist Party, Local Governance, Economic and Social Policy, Foreign Policy, Nationalism in China and Democratisation and China."

In this course unit we will examine aspects of the work of the four most important Twentieth Century phenomenologists: Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, Jean-Paul Sartre and Maurice Merleau-Ponty. Topics covered may include: the nature of intentionality, perception and imagination; our awareness of self, body and others; and our consciousness of time. We shall also look at what is distinctive about the methods of phenomenological philosophy."

536,667632,Mediterranean Politics,"This course is designed to give students a realistic perspective on past and present democracy in Southern Europe using the case studies of Italy and Spain. The course begins with a careful look at what democratic transitions entail, both in theory and in practice. It will quickly become apparent that no democracy comes close to fulfilling all of the ideals we associate with ""democracy"" and that Southern European democracies share various characteristics in both their political and economic development in the twentieth century. Winston Churchill's quip that ""democracy"" is the worst form of government, except for all the rest"" is however, as true for Southern Europe as it is for other areas of the world. To help students make their own evaluation of the virtues and shortcomings of democracy in Southern Europe, the course examines the democratic transitions, political systems, constitutional rule of law and a wide variety of political parties in Italy and Spain. The course also covers the historical origins of Italian and Spanish democracy and party systems, as well as the issues of regionalism/nationalism and the Europeanisation of Southern European politics."

1094,667600,Mind and World,"The philosophy of mind and philosophy of language are central areas of contemporary analytical philosophy. This course unit serves as an introduction to some important and fascinating issues in these areas. We will read classic texts drawn from historical and contemporary sources. The course will begin with a study of one of Descartes¿s most famous and influential arguments for his claim that the mind is an immaterial substance distinct from the body and that can survive the death of the body, the so-called ¿conceivability argument¿. We then explore materialist theories of mind that identify mental states with physical states.    We also examine the doctrine of functionalism about the mental and one of the ideas it has inspired: computer minds. We then turn to the currently hot topic of consciousness, which is deemed to be an intractable mystery by some and a non-physical phenomenon by others. The remaining topics focus in one way or another on problems and puzzles about the ¿intentionality¿ of thought and language. Intentionality is the property of being directed towards something, being about something, or representing something. Our thoughts and our language reach out to or aim at or represent things beyond themselves. How are they able to do this? What gives the sentences of language their meaning and how do the words they contain manage to refer to things in reality? This course unit serves as an excellent introduction to more advanced topics covered in Philosophy of Mind and Philosophy of Language."
1095,667603,20th Century Philosophy,"Analytical philosophy has become the dominant tradition in contemporary philosophy and yet it is scarcely a century old. In this course we will explore the rise of this philosophical tradition by studying the historical conditions and figures that gave birth to it and some of the important problems, methods, and principles that have shaped and continue to shape it. We shall also examine some contemporary work in this tradition.    We begin by looking very briefly at the Post-Kantian, Absolute Idealist philosophy that dominated the British scene at the turn of the century and the rise of the new mathematical logic that helped to displace it. We then turn to the revolutionary works of Gottlob Frege, G. E. Moore, and Bertrand Russell, and the different roles they each played in setting the agenda for subsequent philosophy in the analytical tradition.    We go on to look at some of the most important philosophical developments in analytical philosophy after these great foundational works, such as Logical Positivism, Ordinary Language Philosophy, W. V. Quine¿s famous attack on the analytic/synthetic distinction and modality in general, and the effect of this attack on the materialist approach to the mind-body problem. Turing to more recent work, we explore Saul Kripke¿s celebrated revival of modal metaphysics and conclude with a study of the influential doctrine of externalism in the philosophhy of mind and language.    The course provides excellent background for the following advanced courses: PHIL 30252 Wittgenstein and PHIL30312 Philosophy of Language."

1102,667598,Philosophy & Social Sciences,"What is science? Science is our best for finding out about the world. But what accounts for its success? And what does it take for something to be a science?  We will investigate whether there are any methods or techniques that are distinctive of science. We will also investigate what distinguishes science from non-science. Various criteria have been offered and we will assess some of the leading ones.    Knowledge and explanation  Knowing involves more than having a true belief. Someone can believe something and, quite by luck, their belief is true. We will investigate what more is involved in knowing something. Explanation involves more than knowledge. Someone can know that the same side of the moon always faces the Earth without having an explanation why. So what more does explaining something involve? We will assess a leading theory of scientific explanation.    Prediction and probability Many of our beliefs and decisions are based on uncertain reasoning. There is good evidence that global warming is an unprecedented change caused by emission of greenhouse gases; but to conclude that this is the case on this evidence is risky, since the trend could be within normal climatic variations. An investor concludes that it is safe to buy pounds sterling on the basis of a forecast of UK currency trends: this is an uncertain conclusion because the financial model could be wrong or other factors come into play. These lectures introduce risky arguments and show you ways of picking out the good ones and avoid getting duped by the bad ones. The lectures will look at notions of fairness, bias and independence. We will also look at the Gambler's Fallacy and theories of probability.    Action. Social science studies social phenomena, but what are these? Once upon a time social science was classed with the behavioural sciences for it studied group behaviours. Philosophers are careful to draw a distinction between behaviour and action: action is behaviour that is intentional under at least one true description. And action is social, according to a famous definition, ¿insofar as its subjective meaning takes account of the behaviour of others and is thereby oriented in its course¿ (M. Weber). We will unpack these definitions and consider what it might mean to explain an action.    Norms, conventions, traditions and social relativism. Social science does not just study social actions but also what prompts and constrains actors in their doings. Certain things are just ¿not done¿, other things are outright forbidden by law, yet other things highly prized. If norms are just conventions, what are conventions? How are they arrived at and what keeps them in place? And what are institutions and gives them their authority? We will look at two different answers to these questions and then consider whether the wide variety of customs and conceptual frameworks found across humankind licences the view that there is no universal standard of rationality."

1107,667607,"Locke, Berkeley and Hume","This course is devoted to studying the empiricist philosophies of Locke, Berkeley and Hume, focusing on the core texts by each. The issues raised by these philosophers have been profoundly important in shaping the landscape of contemporary analytical philosophy and many of the problems they raised and addressed are as relevant to philosophy today as they were then. Questions about, for example, the possibility of innate ideas, the nature of perception, the existence of a reality independently of our minds, and the laws of nature, have all been handed down to us, in part, as a legacy of empiricism.    The course will approach the subject both by examining the philosophical works of Locke, Berkeley and Hume, and by looking at the ways in which their insights and concerns have been inherited by current analytical philosophers."

1590,667479,Theatricality and Madness,"MODULE DESCRIPTION    This module aims to focus on one particular theme, representations of madness, in selected contemporary plays. The module is premised upon the idea that theatricality and madness meet within the area of `performance¿. It will explore the notion of madness as it is portrayed dramatically, in terms of individual psychology, sexual conflict, social and political manipulation. In parallel, it will consider the theatrical aspects of madness suggested by such words as mask, persona, utterance; dissembling and concealment; violence and discovery.    LEARNING OUTCOMES    On successful completion of this module, you will be able to:  1. Analyse the differing ways in which certain contemporary playwrights have  exploited the theatrical trope of madness.  2. Identify and explain how contemporary playwrights have illuminated the inner  worlds of men and women.  3. Demonstrate how playwrights can work upon the senses and sensibilities of theatre audiences.  4. Discuss how playwrights represent society¿s positioning of the individual by means of designation and the operation of language."

1600,667503,Independent Study,"MODULE DESCRIPTION    This module, a double one, extending over two semesters, aims to facilitate your undertaking a piece of independently researched work, on a topic generated by you in negotiation with a designated tutor. The topic will allow you to examine an area in depth and, in doing so, to extend your understanding, skills and analyses developed through the first two years of the programme. It will take the form of a dissertation (also known as an extended essay) of between 6-8000 words. The negotiations are highly flexible, but you would normally be expected to study between 3 and 5 primary texts, no more than 50% of which should derive from American literary culture. Your study should not substantially reproduce work undertaken in other Level 6 modules and this usually means that only one text studied before can be re-used. Your approach in terms of research methodology, theoretical basis and level of engagement reflects the increased intellectual sophistication of the taught programme at Level 6.    LEARNING OUTCOMES    On successful completion of the module, you will be able to:  1. Demonstrate advanced research competence utilising the specialised skill associated with literary studies, through the gathering, organisation and processing of a variety of materials (ie primary, secondary, theoretical), via electronic and hard copy retrieval.  2.

1605,667627,Intro to Int Politics,"It is divided into four sections:    International Relations Theory  This section of the course introduces students to some of the theoretical debates that dominate International Relations (IR) thinking (in particular idealism and realism). These theoretical approaches will be referred back to throughout the course and it is essential that students gain a firm grasp of the key concepts and issues introduced in these first few lectures.    International History  The second half of semester one is given over to the study of international history since 1945. This part of the course provides students with an historical overview within which to locate current issues in global politics. Throughout this section of the course, students will be required to think about how changing historical circumstances altered the agenda of the academic study of IR. In particular, how has the development of certain theoretical paradigms within the discipline been shaped by historical events?    Security Studies  This section of the course introduces students to the study of security issues in international politics. Security issues remain central to the study of international relations, especially in the context of the post-9/11 world. In this section of the course, students are asked to consider how security issues have changed since the end of the cold war and the relationship between state security and international organisations such as the UN and NATO.    International Political Economy  It is increasingly recognised that the study of international politics needs to be about more than just the study of war and peace. International Political Economy (IPE) considers the linkages between politics and economics (or the state and the market) at the global level. In this section of the course, we introduce students to the study of IPE focussing on the way in which an IPE perspective helps us to make sense of the debates surrounding `globalisation¿."

1608,667602,Philosophical Logic,"The course will combine an extension of some of the technical aspects of logic studied in PHIL10052 with an application of these to philosophical issues. We will cover topics including modal logic, metalogic, non-classical logic, and aspects of natural language semantics including quantification and the metaphysics of propositional content.    Philosophical logic embraces logic in both its pure and applied forms, examining the philosophical issues arising out of each. We will see how to extend and deviate from elementary classical logic in ways that either generate new philosophical puzzles or arise in response to already existing ones. Particular emphasis will be plays on the interaction between formal logic and natural language semantics: we will look in detail, for example, at how formal techniques are employed to explain the meanings of modal expressions, temporal expressions, and definite descriptions in natural languages, as well as considering the meanings of the logical constants and how to they relate to natural language expressions. This will lead to a re-examination of the validity of the laws of classical logic."

Is it either consistent or plausible to believe that there is a God given the amount of evil in the world? Can we ever be justified in believing that a miracle has occurred? Is religious belief rational if there is no evidence in its favour? What is the relationship between scientific and religious belief?    In the course of examining these topics we will look at major 20th century and contemporary writings on religious belief and language, including work by Ludwig Wittgenstein, Alvin Plantinga and Richard Swinburne"

2057,666728,Microeconomic Analysis I,"The concern of economics with the behavior of economic decision making has led it to develop models of individual decision making units within the economy. The consumer and the company are the two principal types of such units, apart from the state sector. The literature of economics has therefore developed theories of the consumer and of the company. This course is concerned with the former, stressing the importance of alternative paradigms with an emphasis onthe use of choice theory in policy analysis."

2646,667481,The Radiant Hour,"MODULE DESCRIPTION    In this module you will explore how youth has been represented in American culture, using literary texts as your main focus. The module will, however, develop its discussion of the portrayal of youth in a range of texts, both literary and non-literary, and in the process raise key questions about the significance of youth within American culture. In particular, the module will examine the construction of gender identity as a concern of youth texts, alongside other key relationships such as those between youth and authority and various  institutions of power (family, school, etc). You will also address notions of rebellion, despair, sexuality, sincerity, and ¿phoniness¿ as they emerge as important issues in the texts studied. This module will draw upon certain cultural and theoretical ideas (feminism, discourse, myth, etc) to understand the social issues raised in these texts and enable you to draw comparisons across different materials.    INTENDED LEARNING OUTCOMES    On successful completion of this module, you will be able to:  1. Discuss and debate ideas about youth culture in a critical and informed way,  drawing on a range of readings, including theoretical and secondary texts.  2. Understand and evaluate important themes and concerns that occur and reoccur across a range of youth texts."

2736,667502,Poetry as Creative & Critical,"MODULE DESCRIPTION    In this module, you will read modern and contemporary poetry and have the opportunity to write poetry, with particular attention to the way in which poems read each other. That is, we will consider the way in which poetry evolves out of a conversation with other poems (tradition) as well as from a conversation with other media and responsiveness to contemporary life. The module emphasises the close link between attuned reading and appreciative writing, whether creative or critical. The module fosters an awareness of, on  the one hand, the way attempts at creative writing can help foster a critical sensibility and, on the other, the way in which reading critically can assist the creative process. Although we will read widely in modern and contemporary poetry, every year we will select a single contemporary poet whose work will provide a focus for the module and for your written work. You will be encouraged to work with contemporary less-established poets, as well as looking back to the influence of well-known work.    LEARNING OUTCOMES    On successful completion of this module, you will be able to:  1. Interpret and evaluate modern or contemporary poetry in an appropriate creative and/or critical format.  2. Critically discuss the use of a range of forms and techniques particular to poetry using an appropriate technical/conceptual vocabulary.  3.

2750,667497,American Noir,"MODULE DESCRIPTION    In this module you will examine the dark tendencies in American literature and culture developing in contrast to the ideologies of the Promised Land and the American Dream. We will look at the European Gothic tradition and the reasons for this genre being taken up and extended in America. The persistence of this interest in the uncanny, the supernatural, the deviant and the transgressive in American culture will be the main focus of the module. We will discuss the strands of this tendency in historical, psychological and cultural terms as reflected in representative expressive literature, film and art from different periods. We will examine how the Gothic has mutated and altered over time and re-emerged in and influenced the creation of new forms, and examine how it has been appropriated for new creative and political purposes (detective fiction, film noir, cyberpunk, feminism, social critique). Particular  attention will be paid to the function of 'anti-mythography' and social criticism, as well as formal experimentation and subversion in discussing the purposes of the genre.    LEARNING OUTCOMES    On successful completion of this module, you will be able to:  1. Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of theories and concepts of  `gothic/noir¿ and its developments and changes within an American context.  2. Discuss, interpret and critically interrogate different texts using a variety of  critical and theoretical perspectives."

The topics in epistemology concern such questions as: What is knowledge? What is it to perceive something? Can we know anything through the use of reason alone? What is it for our beliefs to be justified? What is the scope of our knowledge?    The topics in metaphysics concern such questions as: What is realism? What are the opposing views to realism? What is it for one event to cause another? What is it to be a person? What is it to be the same person as you were in the past? Does time flow? Do we have free will?"

2795,667621,Philosophy of Action,"Whenever you say hello to someone, or shake their hand, or kiss their lips, you perform an action. But what sort of thing is an action? How does doing something differ from undergoing something, or having something done to you? What makes one action the same as, or different from, another action? (If you smile and say hello, is this one action or two?) Many actions involve bodily movements, but are actions identical with bodily movements? Could it be that some actions consist in less than a bodily movement, whereas others consist in more? Are there rational justifications for performing some actions rather than others? If so, what sorts of justifications are they, and what sort of practical thinking or deliberation can enable us to appreciate them? Under what circumstances, if any, is an action either (i) voluntary, (ii) intentional, or (iii) free? What sorts of explanations are explanations of people¿s actions? Are all actions performed by individuals, or can an action be performed by a group?    In this course, we will focus on these and other questions of the philosophy of action."

2806,667608,Philosopy of Science,"This course introduces several major controversies in the philosophy of science and uses them to investigate the nature of science, its methods, and its accomplishments. We discuss the following:    The problem of induction: why believe that any pattern of events which has been observed will occur again? Can the past behaviour of things give reason to predict how they will behave? Are such predictions unjustified and irrational?    Popper's non-inductive methodology: instead of taking observations to confirm theories, should we take observations only to refute theories? This is Popper's methodology of 'trial and error'.    Kuhn's account of scientific revolutions: what is a scientific revolution, and why do such revolutions occur? Can such revolutions have rational grounds or are they cases of 'mob psychology'?    The nature of explanation: what is it for a scientific theory to explain an event? Is it enough that the theory entails that the event occurs?    The nature of confirmation: what counts as evidence for a theory? Is any true consequence of a theory evidence for it?    Laws of nature: what is a law of nature? What is the difference between it and any widespread uniform series of events?    Scientific realism: should we believe what scientific theories claim about things we cannot observe?"
2807,667613,Metaphysics,This course will introduce students to some of the most lively debates in contemporary metaphysics. We will be considering the following questions. What is the nature of material objects? How do we deal with the paradoxes that they generate? Should we believe in properties (such as wisdom or triangularity)? How should we account for possibility and necessity? Are there such things as possible worlds or merely possible objects?
