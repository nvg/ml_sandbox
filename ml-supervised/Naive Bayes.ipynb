    "# Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "Uses Bayes' Theorem for estimating probabilites `P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)`\n",
    "\n",
    "The 'naive' is due to the assumption that is required for Bayes to work optimally - all features must be independent of each other\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "* Easy and fast to predict the class of the test data set.\n",
    "* Performs well in multi-class prediction.\n",
    "* When assumption of independence holds, it performs better compare to other models like logistic regression and you need less training data.\n",
    "* Perform well in case of categorical input variables compared to numerical variable(s). \n",
    "* For numerical variable, normal distribution is assumed (bell curve, which is a strong assumption).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantage\n",
    "\n",
    "* If categorical variable has a category (in test data set), which was not observed in training data set, then model will assign a 0 (zero) probability and will be unable to make a prediction. This is often known as Zero Frequency. To solve this, we can use the smoothing technique. One of the simplest smoothing techniques is called Laplace estimation.\n",
    "* Naive Bayes is also known as a bad estimator, so the probability outputs are not to be taken too seriously.\n",
    "* Another limitation of Naive Bayes is the assumption of independent predictors. In real life, it is almost impossible that we get a set of predictors which are completely independent.\n",
